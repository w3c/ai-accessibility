   abstract = {This study examines the accessibility of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools for people with disabilities, using WCAG 2.2 success criteria as a reference. Significant accessibility issues were identified in the evaluated applications, highlighting barriers mainly affecting disabled users. Integrating accessibility considerations from the beginning of application development and adopting a proactive approach are emphasized. Although challenges are faced, such as the shortage of inclusive training data and opacity in AI decision-making, the need to continue addressing various aspects of accessibility in the field of generative AI tools is acknowledged. These efforts are based on regulatory compliance and ethical principles to ensure equal societal participation, regardless of individual abilities. The fundamental role of accessibility in realizing this vision is highlighted, aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, particularly those related to equality, education, innovation, and inclusion. Improving accessibility meets regulatory requirements and contributes to a broader global agenda for a more equitable and sustainable future.&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doi:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.28991/ESJ-2024-08-04-021&quot;&gt;10.28991/ESJ-2024-08-04-021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Full Text:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/index.php/ESJ/article/view/2399/pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;},

This paper addresses the primary accessibility issues, such as missing Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) landmarks, ill-formed headings, low contrast text, and inadequate form labeling. The dynamic nature of modern web and cloud applications presents challenges, such as developers' limited awareness of accessibility implications, potential code bugs, and API failures. To address these issues, an AI-enabled system is proposed to dynamically enhance web accessibility. The system uses machine learning algorithms to identify and rectify accessibility issues in real-time, integrating with existing development workflows. Empirical evaluation and case studies demonstrate the efficacy of this solution in improving web accessibility across diverse scenarios.},

   abstract = {While AI technologies and tools offer various potential benefits to their users, it is not clear whether opportunities to access these benefits are equally accessible to all. We examine this gap between availability and accessibility as it relates to the adoption of AI-Mediated Communication (AI-MC) tools, which enable interpersonal communication where an intelligent agent operates on behalf of a communicator. Upon defining six functional AI-MC types (voice-assisted communication, language correction, predictive text suggestion, transcription, translation, personalized language learning) we conducted an online survey of 519 U.S. participants that combined closed- and open-ended measures. Our quantitative results revealed how AI-MC adoption is related to software, device, and internet access for tools such as voice-assisted communication; demographic factors such as age, education and income in the case of translation and transcription tools; and some components of AI-MC literacy for specific functional tools. Our qualitative analyses provide additional nuance for these findings, and we articulate a number of barriers to access, understanding, and usage of AI-MC tools, which we suggest hinder AI-MC accessibility for user groups traditionally disadvantaged by one-size-fits-all technological tools. We end with a call for broadly addressing accessibility concerns within the digital technology industry.},

Some research regarding current product available is done to develop a better reading device. This reading device is an improvement from previous project which only focuses on single language which is not suitable for public places. This reading device will take a picture of the book using 5MP Pi camera, Google Vision API will extract the text, and Google Translation API will detect the language and translated to desired language based on push buttons input by user. Google Text-to-Speech will convert the text to speech and the device will read out aloud in through audio output like speaker or headphones.   A few testings have been made to test the functionality and accuracy of the reading device. The testings are functionality, performance test and usability test. The reading device passed most of the testing and get a score of 91.7/100 which is an excellent (A) rating&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;},

   abstract = {Unlike able-bodied persons, it is difficult for visually impaired people, especially those in the educational age, to build a full perception of the world due to the lack of normal vision. The rapid development of AI and sensing technologies has provided new solutions to visually impaired assistance. However, to our knowledge, most previous studies focused on obstacle avoidance and environmental perception but paid less attention to educational assistance for visually impaired people. In this paper, we propose AviPer, a system that aims to assist visually impaired people to perceive the world via creating a continuous, immersive, and educational assisting pattern. Equipped with a self-developed flexible tactile glove and a webcam, AviPer can simultaneously predict the grasping object and provide voice feedback using the vision-tactile fusion classification model, when a visually impaired people is perceiving the object with his gloved hand. To achieve accurate multimodal classification, we creatively embed three attention mechanisms, namely temporal, channel-wise, and spatial attention in the model. Experimental results show that AviPer can achieve an accuracy of 99.75% in classification of 10 daily objects. We evaluated the system in a variety of extreme cases, which verified its robustness and demonstrated the necessity of visual and tactile modal fusion. We also conducted tests in the actual use scene and proved the usability and user-friendliness of the system. We opensourced the code and self-collected datasets in the hope of promoting research development and bringing changes to the lives of visually impaired people.},

   abstract = {Generative AI tools allow anyone without web-design experience to have a business website created when the user provides a few specifications about the business, such as its name, type, and location. But the resulting websites not only fall short of the business's basic needs but they also raise major concerns about their accessibility for disabled users. This study specifically examines whether these AI generated websites are accessible to screen-reader users with visual disabilities. It presents data about the usability and accessibility of the products of three generative AI website builders, highlights the specific problems found by an expert screen reader test along with an automated machine scan of these sites, and discusses some causes of and recommendations for solving these problems.},

We can see visually impaired people using sticks or any other means for doing their tasks, but they can’t find or identify any object by themselves. In today’s world, there are many advancements in technology like artificial intelligence, machine learning where we can train machines for identifying different objects and different text present in a scene. The objective of this work is to develop a system using Esp32 Camera module to help the visually impaired to identify objects. The proposed system takes images from Esp32 and identifies different objects and text present in the scene and gives the output in the form of speech. The system has a voice assistant with commands for performing object detection, text detection and camera usage. This research helps visually impaired people in various aspects like object detection and text detection using voice commands and they can listen to the description of different objects detected by the system. The results show training accuracy of 97% and test accuracy of 88% using deep learning CNN models.},

   abstract = {Sign language is the natural way of communication of speech and hearing-impaired people. Using Indian Sign Language (ISL) interpretation system, hearing impaired people may interact with normal people with the help of Human Computer Interaction (HCI). This paper presents a method for automatic recognition of two-handed signs of Indian Sign language (ISL). The three phases of this work include preprocessing, feature extraction and classification. We trained a BPN with Histogram Oriented Gradient (HOG) features. The trained model is used for testing the real time gestures. The overall accuracy achieved was 89.5% with 5184 input features and 50 hidden neurons. A deep learning approach was also implemented using AlexNet, GoogleNet, VGG-16 and VGG-19 which gave accuracies of 99.11%, 95.84%, 98.42% and 99.11% respectively. MATLAB is used as the simulation platform. The proposed technology is used as a teaching assistant for specially abled persons and has demonstrated an increase in cognitive ability of 60–70% in children. This system demonstrates image processing and machine learning approaches to recognize alphabets from the Indian sign language, which can be used as an ICT (information and communication technology) tool to enhance their cognitive capability.},

   abstract = {The impact of technological innovations in our lives has never been greater, for instance the use of assistive technology and artificial intelligence has resulted in smart devices, such as voice assistants (VA). However, empirical studies that understand the impact of VA technology on the individual and collective well-being of vulnerable people are still scarce. Thus, by conducting a series of longitudinal studies within the ecosystem of physically and visually impaired people, our study aims to respond to this void in the literature. Over a period of 30 weeks, we carried out 5 longitudinal case studies, and collected data from semi-structured interviews (n = 25), informal conversations (n = 23), observations (n = 25) and a focus group with participants (n = 8), as well as secondary data collected from the VA device reports. Our results identified themes related to the impact of technology on well-being, challenges and improvements, relationship building, privacy concerns and a gap between technology and inclusiveness. Furthermore, under the transformative service lens, we developed a framework that illustrates how interactions between people with disability and the VA technology co-design and co-create value for individual and collective well-being.},

   abstract = {Information and communication technology has many promising benefits including improvement the traffic network capacity, efficiency, and stability. However, to date, most of the improvements in signal management and interactions in connected vehicle environments focus solely on the vehicular side. This has led to a massive gap for non-motorized users and vulnerable road users. Specifically, deficit perception capability, inconsistent dissemination, obsolescent acquisition techniques, and ignorance of equality make the current experience of the active non-motorized users inconvenient and risky, especially for those with disabilities. To serve the users in an unbiased and automated way, a novel cooperated signal phase and timing (SPaT) services infrastructure — Vision Enhanced Non-motorized Users Services (VENUS) smart node is proposed. With customized up-to-date computer vision algorithms and artificial intelligence pipelines on the edge, VENUS smart node can collect necessary active-user information (including location, class, pose direction and mobility status), and generate directional crossing request for every pedestrian and cyclist in real time. Meanwhile, the improved communication system makes the VENUS node a reliable information hub to share the SPaT messages and carry interactions to/from the signal controller, connected vehicles and user personal information devices (i.e., cell phones, wearable devices) through various protocols. Based on extensive experimentation, 1076 testing users from six intersections, the VENUS sensing achieves 90.24% accuracy on directional-aware crossing trigger generation and 89.87% accuracy on mobility status estimation for normal users and four types of disabled persons. Furthermore, the VENUS smart node is fully compatible with the connected vehicles environment, and improves the signal system at low cost, mainly due to its flexibility and adaptability with existing infrastructure. The VENUS smart node is the first connected infrastructure architecture that integrates traffic sensing, data processing and information dissemination together for the self-operating indistinguishable signal services based on edge computing.},

   abstract = {Speech-to-text technology (also referred to as automatic speech recognition, or ASR) is now available in apps and software, offering opportunities for deaf/hard of hearing students to have real time captioning at their fingertips. However, speech-to-text technology must be proven to be accurate before it should be considered as an accommodation for students. This study assessed the accuracy of eight apps, software and platforms to provide captions for i) a university lecture given by a native English speaker in real time ii) a video of the lecture, and iii) a conversation between 3 students in real time, using real speech under controlled acoustical conditions. Accuracy of transcribed speech was measured in two ways: a Total Accuracy score indicating % of words transcribed accurately, and as a Meaning Accuracy score, which considered transcription errors which impacted the meaning of the message. Technologies evaluated included Interact Streamer, Ava, Otter, Google Slides, Microsoft Stream, Microsoft Translator, Camtasia Studio and YouTube. For the lecture condition, 4 of 5 technologies evaluated exceeded 90% accuracy, with Google Slides and Otter achieving 98 and 99%% accuracy. Overall accuracy for video captioning was highest, with 5 of 6 technologies achieving greater than 90% accuracy, and accuracy rates for YouTube, Microsoft Stream and Otter of 98-99%. Accuracy for captioning a real time conversation between 3 students was greater than 90% for both technologies evaluated, Ava and Microsoft Translator. Results suggest that, given excellent audio quality, speech-to-text technology accuracy is sufficient to consider use by postsecondary students.},
